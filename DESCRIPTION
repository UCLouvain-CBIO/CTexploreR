Description: a package that re-defines the list of CT genes based on publicly available 
  RNAseq databases (GTEx, CCLE and TCGA) and summarises their main characteristics. Several 
  visualisation functions allow to explore their expression in different types of tissues and 
  cancer cells, or to inspect the methylation status of their promoters in normal tissues.
