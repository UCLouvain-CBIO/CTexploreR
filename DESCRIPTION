Description: The CTexploreR package re-defines the list of Cancer
  Testis/Germline (CT) genes. It is based on publicly available RNAseq
  databases (GTEx, CCLE and TCGA) and summarises CT genes' main
  characteristics. Several visualisation functions allow to explore
  their expression in different types of tissues and cancer cells, or
  to inspect the methylation status of their promoters in normal
  tissues.
