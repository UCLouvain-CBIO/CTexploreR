# CTexploreR package

The `CTexploreR` package re-defines the list of Cancer Testis (CT)
genes (also known a Cancer Germline genes) based on publicly available
RNAseq databases (GTEx, CCLE and TCGA) and summarises their main
characteristics. Several visualisation functions allow to explore
their expression in different types of tissues and cancer cells, or to
inspect the methylation status of their promoters in normal tissues.
